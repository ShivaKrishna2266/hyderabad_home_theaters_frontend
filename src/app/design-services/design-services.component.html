                <p class="text-left">
                    The sound you hear in any room is a combination of the direct sound that travels straight from your
                    speakers to your ears, and the indirect reflected sound the sound from your speakers that bounces
                    off the walls, floors, ceiling and furniture before it reaches your ears. The good part is that they
                    make music and movie dialogue sound much fuller and louder than they would otherwise. Reflected
                    sound can add a pleasant spaciousness to your sound.

            As a seasoned member of CEDIA, you can be sure that your system will be built to the best specifications and
            have the newest features.<br><br><br><br>





            We will guarantee excellence in every home theater installation and corporate layout development that
            Hyderabad Home
            Theaters provides, with customer service being our first focus. <br><br>

            "Surpassing client expectations in every Audio Visual plan" is our design credo. We pay attention to your
            requirements and then design your home theater or office media room using good technique, style, and
            originality at a reasonable price.<br><br><br><br>





            With your ideas and specifications, your Hyderabad Home Theaters System Designer will create a system

            the inspiration, inventiveness, and ingenuity that go into each design they produce. Our exacting technical

            every one of our ideas. <br><br><br><br>







            With the help of concealed cables hidden behind wall and roof cavities, our home theater kits with
            projection and "surround sound" may be installed discreetly. Projectors can be set on the ceiling, and
            speakers can be placed in the walls or ceiling, bracket-mounted, bookshelf-mounted, or floor-standing.
            Subwoofers can be installed beneath the seats or in the ceiling. In either case, the whole theater
            experience will be enhanced by being able to hear and feel every tiny vibration.<br><br><br><br>



            To ensure that you get the most out of your system, an installer will mount the projection screen at the
            proper throw distance and, after finished, calibrate the system room. To install your home theater kits, we
            have staff in Hyderabad , Mumbai Haryana & Banglore and other cities.<br><br>

            Senior members of the team who work in sound, video, and lighting have extensive knowledge of corporate and
